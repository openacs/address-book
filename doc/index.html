<h2>Address Book Documentation</h2>

<p>
The Address Book is an application/service hybrid.  As an application, it provides a complete UI for storing, retrieving
and searching for individually permissioned contacts.  As a service, Address Book provides a storage mechanism for
contact information and associating it with other objects.  Each contact has identity info as well as an arbitrary number
of custom attributes (which may be used for phone numbers, email addresses, etc.) and an arbitrary number of street
addresses.
